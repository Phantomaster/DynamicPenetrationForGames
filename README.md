# DynamicPenetrationForGames
 Tools that assist with penetration in the Unity Engine.

# Requirements

This technology relies on Amplify Shader Editor to function. If you don't have it then this is very difficult, if not impossible, to use!

# Installation

First, install dependencies:

- `https://github.com/naelstrof/com.naelstrof.splines.git`
- `https://github.com/naelstrof/UnityJigglePhysics.git#upm`
 
then, finally
- `https://github.com/naelstrof/DynamicPenetrationForGames.git#upm`

Alternatively you can install it by git-cloning manually into the Packages folder, since git permissions are wonky with private repos.
